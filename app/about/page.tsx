        I’m Rick, Director at Totally Digital and have been an SEO - in all the 
        different forms that takes - for over 14 years. I’ve spent years
        building search growth for B2C and B2B brands, the kind measured in
        revenue, not PowerPoints. I bridge product, marketing, and engineering,
        translate constraints, and remove the guesswork from complex changes.

        My default setting is: gather the data, simplify the plan, ship. 
        I enjoy finding and fixing problems both digitally and physically, 
        scaling out websites to drive traffic, working across different disciplines, 
        site architecture, diagnostics, and all the quiet details that keep websites stable at scale.

        Off-screen: cycling, coffee(ran a mildly successful ecom website for a while), running(short distances), and have an unhealthy interest in how AI is
        changing the world - and have been interested a long time before it was cool. I was emailing Ray Kurzweil at Google in 2011 and was reading Superintelligence books back in 2018.
