        I’m Rick Talbot, Director at Totally Digital. I’ve spent 14+ years
        building search growth for B2C and B2B brands — the kind measured in
        revenue, not PowerPoints. I bridge product, marketing, and engineering,
        translate constraints, and remove drama from complex changes.

      <p className="mt-4 text-neutral-700">
        My default setting is: gather the data, simplify the plan, ship in
        increments. I enjoy finding and fixing problems, scaling out websites
        to drive traffic, working across different disciplines, architecture, 
        diagnostics, and all the quiet details that keep SEO stable at scale.

        Off-screen: coffee, running, and an unhealthy interest in how AI is
        changing the world - and have been since before it was cool.
